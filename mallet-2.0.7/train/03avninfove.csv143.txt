"Mandela's long walk | AVN Special Reports Mandela's long walk por Raul Cazal   Caracas 02 Jul AVN- Mandela's first name means ""agitator"" That name is not ""Nelson"" – which his teacher Miss Mdingane gave him in the first day at a British school in South Africa – but ""Rolihlahla"" as his father called him when he was born on July 18 1918 in Mvezo a town by Mbashe river district of Mthatha capital of Transkei Mandela does not think that names define destiny but his life has honored the way his father called him ""In xhosa [tribe or people] Rolihlahla means literally 'breaking off tree branches' but its local meaning is closer to 'agitator'"" these are the first words Mandela wrote in his autobiographical work Long walk to freedom Currently he is estimated as champion of ""non-violence"" and ""civil disobedience"" the same characteristics usually used to vindicate Mahatma Gandhi Nonetheless Mandela chose that way as strategy despite his ""heart knew it was not the answer"" He had no other option given the disadvantage of fighting a fascist repressive criminal State which had worsened its racist policies after the National Party came to power in South Africa in 1948 This party was sympathizer with Nazi Germany and came to power under a hatred campaign focused on two slogans Die kaffer op sy plek (Kaffir [black] in his place) and Die koelies uit die land (The coolies [Indians] out of the country) This way started to be legally implemented something that had already been established since the Dutch and British (mainly) began to colonize South Africa by the mid of the 17th century apartheid ""Apartheid started from a premise white people were superior to Africans Indians and Colored The new system's objective was to implement white supremacy once and for all As the National Party expressed it 'Die with man moet altyd baas wees' (White men shall always be boss) Its program included the term baasskap – which literally means lord – a poisoned word which embodied the meaning of white supremacy in all its cruelty"" writes Mandela at the autobiography In 1947 he was elected member of the African National Congress (ANC) executive board He had not been involved in any significant campaign until then and he ""did not understand the risks and incalculable difficulties of the life of a freedom fighter so far"" Since then he identified with the ""Congress as a whole with its hopes and dismays achievements and failures"" and he kept ""tied to it wholeheartedly"" Details of a militant life The Christian education that schools imposed by that time made the model of ""cultured British"" be the pattern that South Africans must follow They aspired to be ""black British"" as they were pejoratively called For that reason Mandela may not specify the moment he engaged in politics or when he realized that he would devote his life to ""fight for freedom Being black in South Africa entails being politicized since one is born whether you know it or not African children are born in hospitals for black people they are taken home in buses exclusively for black people they live in barrios for black people and if they may they go to a school only with black children"" After joining ANC in 1944 he took part that same year on the foundation of the Youth League and is elected member of the executive board together with A P Mda Jordan Ngubane Lionel Majombozi Congress Mbata and Davida Bopape Anton Lembede doctor in Arts and bachelor in Laws was elected president ""Basic politics in the League was not different at all from ANC's first constitution in 1912 Nevertheless we were reaffirming ourselves and highlighting those original proposals many of whom had remained put aside in the road African nationalism was our battle cry and our creed was creating a nation from several tribes overthrowing white supremacy and establishing a really democratic way of government"" Mandela initially upheld the thesis of ""African nationalism"" and some apparently irreconcilable disagreements rose with communist militants who shared the same battles for freedom until he began to study Marx Engels Lenin Stalin and Mao Zedong among others ""Though I felt quite encouraged by the Communist Manifesto I was exhausted with The Capital However I felt deeply attracted by the idea of a society without classes which I think was a similar concept to the traditional African culture in which life is communal and shared I endorsed Marx's basic mandate simple and generous as a golden rule 'From each according to his ability to each according to his need'"" Dialectical materialism was ""a light which enlightened the dark night of racial oppression and a tool which might be used to end it Similarly I found accurate the materialist analysis of economics The idea that the value of commodities based on the amount of labor carried out to manufacture them seemed particularly appropriate for South Africa The prevailing class paid African working force a salary of mere subsistence and then added capital gains which they kept at the cost of commodities"" Since that moment there was not any contradiction between African nationalism and dialectical materialism for Mandela ""I was determined to make use of any needed mean to expedite the disappearance of human prejudices and put an end to chauvinist and violent nationalism I did not need to become a communist to work with communists I found many more common issues than disagreements Most cynical people have always suggested that communists used us But who may affirm that it was not us who used them?"" A ""terrorist"" president Mandela endured persecutions clandestineness confinement trials and imprisonment in several opportunities In August 1952 after having worked as legal assistant at liberals' offices and obtained a degree he opened his own firm together with Oliver Tambo ""Working as lawyer in South Africa meant to act within a vile justice system and abide by a legal code which did not base on equality"" On June 12 1964 Mandela suffered personally that inequality he was charged of ""conspiracy"" and condemned to life imprisonment estimated a ""crime of high treason"" For this accusation the segregationist State should had implemented capital punishment as its laws stipulate but the judge claimed to have acted with ""leniency"" The truth is that public demonstrations in South Africa and international pressure in solidarity with all African revolutionaries at trial were conclusive to prevent capital punishment Nelson Mandela was sent to Robben Island Subsequently he was moved to Pollsmoor prison and then to Victor Verster His inmate number 46664 was his name for 27 years Finally on February 1990 he was released under the Frederik de Klerk administration (National Party now New National Party) whom he would share a Peace Nobel Prize in 1993 The first multi-racial elections in South Africa were held on April 27 1994 with universal right to vote ANC won by broad majority with Nelson Mandela as its presidential candidate He remains in history as the first black president of his country though he thought that ""if the battle would be successful it had to go beyond white and black"" Under his term in office through 1999 his name continued appearing (together with the entire ANC) in the list of terrorists that the United States Department of State released worldwide since the Ronald Reagan administration in the early eighties started to use the word ""terrorism"" indiscriminately to refer to those who fought for people's freedom The US regime kept him in that list up to 2008 Mandela walked a long road to reach freedom and as the final lines of the auto-biography reads that ""long road has not come to an end""   Translation by AVN Raul Cazal AVN 02/07/2013 1203 Special Reports Raise your awareness!
